ETL Process Practice:

Practice following the ETL process. Identifying relationships between datasets before analysis begins, and 
quantifying them in ERD diagrams.

Then pulling in the data, observing it, and transforming it to fit the needs of the project, or clean it to receive the information that is necessary.

Following that, completing the process by reorginizing and uploading the tables into a database.

Used: Python, SQL, Pandas
